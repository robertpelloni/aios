## 🚀 Mission Accomplished: Core Robustness & Advanced Features (v1.3.0)

This session focused on hardening the Agentic Framework (`@borg/core`) and completing the backlog of critical infrastructure tasks.

### 🌟 Key Achievements
1.  **Smart Auto-Drive (Robustness Phase 4):**
    -   Implemented state-aware steering in `Director.ts`.
    -   **Strict Approvals:** `Alt+Enter` ONLY triggers if terminal explicitly asks `Approve?` or `[y/n]`. No more focus stealing.
    -   **Smart Steering:** If idle > 90s, the Agent proactively reads `task.md` and suggests the next move via chat.
    -   **Emergency Stop:** Added `stop_auto_drive` tool to MCPServer.

2.  **Traffic Inspector (Monitoring Phase 8):**
    -   Live MCP Traffic Visualizer at `http://localhost:3000/dashboard/inspector`.
    -   Uses WebSocket to stream `TOOL_CALL_START` and `TOOL_CALL_END` events.

3.  **Deep Indexing (Memory Phase 9):**
    -   Created `CodeSplitter.ts` replacing naive chunking.
    -   Uses regex-based semantic splitting (function/class boundaries) for superior RAG context.

4.  **Ecosystem Integrations (Phase 6):**
    -   **Jules:** `JulesWrapper.ts` to delegate to Google Agent Framework.
    -   **ADK:** `AgentInterfaces.ts` stubbed for Agent Development Kit support.

5.  **Infrastructure Stubs (Phase 1 & 10):**
    -   `GraphMemory.ts`: Foundational graph node/edge structure.
    -   `AutoConfig.ts`: Logic for detecting K8s/Docker environments (Universal Client).

6.  **Web App Fix:**
    -   Resolved "Missing Production Build" error by cleaning `.next` and running a fresh `pnpm build`.

### 📂 Project State
- **Version:** `1.3.0`
- **Build Status:** Clean (`@borg/core`, `@borg/web` verified).
- **Backlog:** Phases 1-10 in `task.md` are effectively COMPLETE or STUBBED.

### 🔮 Next Steps (Incoming Agent)
1.  **Process Massive Directive Inbox (See `docs/USER_DIRECTIVES_INBOX.md`):**
    -   The user provided 200+ links and specific "dashboarding" instructions.
    -   **Action:** Systematically review `docs/USER_DIRECTIVES_INBOX.md`.
    -   **Submodules:** Initialize `git submodule add` for key repos like `jules-autopilot`.
    -   **Dashboards:** Expand `apps/web/src/app/dashboard/architecture/page.tsx` to read real git submodule data.

2.  **Universal Client:** Flesh out `AutoConfig.ts` with real `mcpenetes` logic.
3.  **Graph Memory:** Integrate `GraphMemory.ts` with a real DB (Neo4j or FalkorDB).

### 📝 Notes
- `Director.ts` has been extensively patched. It is now much safer to run in "Auto-Drive" mode.
- The Dashboard Inspector is a great debugging tool for watching Agent thought processes in real-time.
