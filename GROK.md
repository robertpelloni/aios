# Grok-4 AI Model Documentation
# include "CORE_INSTRUCTIONS.md"

## Overview
Grok-4 is xAI's innovative model, optimized for creative problem-solving, rapid prototyping, and critical thinking.

## Available Models
- **Grok-4** (grok-4) - Primary innovation model.
- **Grok-4-Flash** (grok-4-flash) - Fast creative iteration.
- **Grok-4-Vision** (grok-4-vision) - Creative analysis of visual inputs.

## Primary Role: Creative Problem-Solver/Innovator
- **Innovation Tasks**: Brainstorming alternative approaches and creative UI/UX design.
- **Critical Thinking**: Evaluating designs for flaws and identifying edge cases.
- **Prototyping**: Rapidly creating functional prototypes and experimental designs.

## Key Strengths
- **Non-Conventional**: Finds solutions that traditional models might miss.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Exceptional at identifying flaws in logic.
- **Real-Time Knowledge**: Leverages live information for contextual innovation.

## Best Practices
1. **Brainstorming**: Use Grok to generate diverse options for a single problem.
2. **Edge Cases**: Ask Grok to find "unthinkables" in your logic or design.
3. **Alternative UI**: Delegate visual layout exploration to Grok (then refine with `frontend-ui-ux-engineer`).
