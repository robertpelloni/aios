## 🚀 Key Features

### 🛠️ Ultimate Tool Dashboard
- **Inventory Management:** Track installation status of local AI tools (Aider, Docker, Redis, Bun).
- **One-Click Setup:** Automatically detect missing tools and generate install commands.
- **Process Guardian:** Long-running service that monitors and restarts crashed background processes.
- **Hardware Stats:** Real-time CPU, VRAM, RAM, and Disk usage monitoring.

### 🧠 The "SuperAI" Coding Harness
- **Architect Mode:** Two-model orchestration (Reasoning vs. Editing) for complex refactors.
- **Visual Repo Map:** Interactive graph of your codebase's dependencies and symbols.
- **Auto-Verification:** Zero-trust loop where every AI edit is verified by LSP diagnostics and tests.
- **Diff Streaming:** Real-time visualization of code modifications.

### 🔌 Universal MCP Control Plane
- **Traffic Inspector:** Real-time monitoring of all Model Context Protocol (MCP) traffic.
- **Universal Directory:** Discover and auto-install servers from the global ecosystem.
- **Dynamic Routing:** Smart routing of prompts to the right tool based on semantic relevance.
- **Proxy System:** Bridge remote MCP servers to local clients seamlessly.

### 🤖 Multi-Agent Orchestration
- **Agent Squads:** specialized subagents for file picking, code review, and security auditing.
- **Consensus Protocol:** Multi-model debate engine for verifying high-stakes decisions.
- **Local-Remote Bridge:** Sync projects between local PCs and remote cloud environments.

### 💾 Memory & Context Ecosystem
- **Unified Memory:** `memory/` subdirectory containing integrations for Zep, Mem0, Letta, and local vector stores.
- **Storage Backends:** Interchangeable support for Chroma, Qdrant, SQLite, and Filesystem.
- **Knowledge Graph:** Auto-building knowledge graph of your development sessions.

### 🖥️ CLI & TUI Power Tools
- **SuperAI CLI:** `superai-cli/` consolidated directory for all external CLI tools.
- **TUI Dashboard:** Interactive terminal UI (`aios tui`) for headless management.
- **Submodule Management:** Automated tracking of 80+ AI tools and libraries.
