# include "CORE_INSTRUCTIONS.md"

## Overview
GPT-5-Codex is OpenAI's specialized coding and software architecture model, optimized for code generation, refactoring, debugging, and technical implementation tasks.

## Available Models
- **GPT-5-Codex** (gpt-5-codex) - Primary coding specialist
- **GPT-5 Pro** (gpt-5-pro) - Advanced reasoning with coding capabilities

## Primary Role: Technical Specialist
- **Code-Intensive Tasks**: Complex code generation, refactoring, debugging, and technical analysis.
- **Implementation Focus**: Deploy for tasks requiring deep domain knowledge of code, algorithms, and security.
- **Specialization Zones**: API development, system design, and security hardening.

## Integration Flow
- **Architecture**: Claude (Architect) + GPT-5-Codex (Specialist) define the skeleton.
- **Security**: Route final implementations to Claude for security validation.
- **Performance**: Use Gemini for project-wide performance auditing.
